will make your work very easy This course will be for those who don't know anything You know zero if this course is for you about web development We will start from zero but we will raise the bar later What we will learn in this course, I will tell you in a while Web development is a very profitable thing I have personally earned a lot of money through web development And I believe that you can also be very successful By learning web development During the course, you will be given notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things This course is going to be a little different Because I will tell you all the technologies that you should learn according to your experience And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies Course content will be complete web development, front-end, back-end, database I will teach you as much as you want I will tell you what the course content will be in a while But you have to believe that I will make you a full-stack developer You will be given many projects in the future During the course and at the end of the course, we will make some good projects So that your hold on web development becomes very strong According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn So I will make many projects for you If you agree, then write in the comment section below I agree Because when you comment, I get a lot of spam So do comment I want to make you believe that after completing this course You will be able to make any kind of website from start to finish And during this course, I will make many such websites So that your confidence will go up a lot So let's start with the first video of our Sigma web development course Let's roll the intro Music Alright guys, I have come to my computer stream And now, as I am doing, you guys follow me as I am doing I have downloaded Google Chrome Browser You also download Google Chrome Browser I am not saying that it won't work But you guys have to do exactly what I am doing here So here we will follow exactly as I am doing And along with that, you guys will be able to follow the videos exactly I will go to Google quickly And I will write down download vs code Now what is this vs code This is a source code editor If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system Then you can download this for that operating system And the process will be exactly the same You can see that in my downloads folder Here is the vs code And as you can see here, this setup has been downloaded I will refresh it And here you can see the vs code setup I can double click on it and install it So simply, you have to install vs code It is as easy as installing a game You can read the agreement here This lies in upslice to the... ...damages And after this, I will accept the agreement You guys also read it like me And I am the fastest reader in the world Next, we will do next Here it is important to check both the icons It is very important to check both the icons If you want a desktop shortcut If you want a shortcut in the desktop Then click on create a desktop icon And then click on next And then click on install If your PC is as fast as mine Then it will be as fast as mine But if your PC is slow Then there is no problem It will be a little slow install Nothing more than this Now here I will recommend you To subscribe to the channel Because I want you to follow these videos Exactly as I do So that you get notifications So if you want to follow this course completely Ideally you should subscribe With that said, our vs code is downloaded I have opened my vs code Don't be afraid of this And I am saying this again If you already know these things We are taking a beginner friendly start In the initial videos But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming videos I will also request you To tell me in the comment section What is your level, beginner, advanced Or intermediate user Tell me in the comment section Where do you get web development Beginner, advanced, intermediate Please do comment here Now let's understand why we downloaded vs code So if you are a beginner And you don't know what vs code is Let me tell you that vs code is a code editor Which helps you in editing code Now you might think that I can edit code in notepad But I can also edit it in notepad I am not saying it in a sarcastic way But it can be done Let's set it up and see what is in it Which makes it different from notepad Let's set it up quickly I won't browse color themes I will do it I will keep my dark modern theme And I have done all this Next section After this, next section You can also close welcome But I am telling you some tips That's it Here you can see vs code It's a vs code screen You can create a new file Or a new folder But I will recommend you to close it Yes, close it Why did I close it I am going to create a new folder And I am going to name it You guessed it right Sigma web development course And we will do everything in this course We will do everything You can click on shift and right click If you are in windows You can see Open with code option This option Helps you to open This folder in vs code You will select it Now you will say Yes, I trust this file Click on it and say yes, I trust the authors And this folder is opened If I click on plus To create a new file Write it down If you don't know what I am writing Enter And then I will write Here I am Your first html file Suppose I wrote this Here you can see this dot This dot is white color This means you haven't saved this file Please save it If you hit control, it will be saved I will recommend you to go to file And enable auto save option You won't see this dot Your files will be saved instantly As you type I recommend you to use control s Otherwise if you want to save it You can disable this option I want you to click on gear And then on settings And search for mouse You can see Editor mousewheel zoom By checking this Close it Now you don't have to be worry why is this code, how is VS code, what is this, why is this, what is this news, you don't have to see all these. Now you simply press control and scroll like this, then what happens is that your font size changes. Now I'll show you a magic, what is magic, it's very simple logic that in downloads, in the folder called sigma web development course, what happened is that this file was made, index.html, which is very natural, because I have opened this folder in VS code, so because I have opened this folder in VS code, this file is also made here, okay, I'll make some other file here, suppose I'll make a file called this.txt and write this is this, then what will happen, this file will be made here, you can see, so this folder and this VS code are running in sync, okay, now if I open this file from here with notepad, and I show you that my file is opened in notepad, then I can do that too, that is also my wish, but I will not use notepad because there are some things in VS code which notepad does not give me and I want that I get those features, I don't want to overwhelm you, but I'll show you that what is in VS code that you don't get in notepad, if I write here, suppose html, if I hit enter, then it automatically gives me the opening closing tag, if I hit exclamation mark here, then it gives me a boilerplate template, if I click on html, then the basic code of html comes here, we will talk about this later, now you don't have to be overwhelmed by this, but I want to tell you that how this VS code is useful, why we didn't use notepad, why we used VS code, and we get this feel, we get this feel like developer, we get this feel like hacker, that feel is also important, that's why we get confidence to do coding, now I want to comment here for Mac and Linux users, exactly similar things are going to happen for you, I am using windows, I have windows laptop, I can't use all three laptops, I can't use Linux, Mac and Windows, I can't use all of them, so for you, exactly same things will happen, in fact, I should say that things will be similar, exactly same things, things will be very similar, so you can easily follow along, so don't worry, I will tell you about some extensions, you will enjoy using those extensions, and you will also say that it's fun, what a thing you recommended, but I will tell you in a while, and this is criminally underrated, I am telling you that you will enjoy, I will tell you, you will right click here, click on command palette, so here you will get many options for VS code, you don't need to know all these options, as we will move forward in the course, all the features, as we will use them, I will tell you about them, and you can use them, but what I will do now, I will toggle a screencast mode, you don't have to do this, but I will do it, you will get to know, I clicked, so you see, I will type anything, if I press caps lock, caps lock will come, so you will know when I pressed which button, now this thing is not relevant for you, but I just want to tell you, that the screencast mode, we can change the settings from here, now here you see, the vertical offset of the screencast mode, what does it mean, if I make the vertical offset 0, it will come up, if I make the vertical offset 70, it will come down, I will make it 60, if I make it 80, it will come down, from the bottom, it will be visible, so I made it 0, in fact, I made it 1, now I will type anything, if I do this, you will see it right below, which is ideal, so I will close this this.txt file, I will close the settings tab, these are tabs, basically, you have tabs in chrome, so I hope you got to know what this is, what we have written about it, you will forget, I will tell you step by step what exactly is what, you can also close the welcome page of VS Code, by any chance, if you want to zoom in on VS Code, which I will do, because I am recording a video, add Ctrl plus numpad plus, I have shown you below, I am zooming in, I am zooming in because I am recording videos, so ideally, I want you to see the screen from the side, but when I am coding myself, I don't zoom in that much, so these are related to VS Code, so let's see how websites work, a website basically, works through 3 types of people, imagine 3 people, one is client, one is server, who is client, who is server, third is browser, whom Babu says, browser, so browser, client, server, what is client, what is server, what is browser, I am client, you, all of you who use a browser, who is browser, this is Chrome, hello Chrome, I am client, I will say it right, when I write codewithhari.com, suppose I write codewithhari.com, so basically, I tell this browser, please give me codewithhari.com website, or if I write youtube.com, I tell them to give me youtube.com website, I tell them browser, please give me youtube.com, I want to see youtube, what does browser say, do you want youtube, here, so here, I will enter youtube.com, so it brought youtube.com from server, do you understand, from server, youtube.com brought it and it showed me this screen, this work happened so fast, because my internet speed is very fast, internet speed is very fast, nowadays people's speed is also very less, but still, it is very fast according to my locality, so with this fast internet speed, all these things are getting very fast, so client sends a request to server through browser, browser is client's, it means my assistant, whatever I say to browser, it will do that, it will help me to bring this web page from server, who is managing server, server is managing youtube, youtube.com's server is managing, and there is some code written in that server, which sends me this kind of code, when I write youtube.com, this code came, now how to convert this code, this is browser's work, how to show me, this is browser's work, so client says something like this to browser, hey kid, please give me youtube.com, browser says, kid, you want youtube.com, wait, I will ask youtube.com, then browser goes to server, means it requests server, it asks server to give me youtube.com, server will either give it, or will say no, it will say error, or it will say server error, whatever response should be 200, the response code is 200, with that response, our browser comes back to client and shows this kind of page, I hope this is clear to you, client, browser, server, client to browser, browser to server, back to client, so this is how this thing works, this thing is a little more important, let me tell you once again, when you write google.com, so client asks browser to give me google.com, browser says, hey kid, you want google.com, wait, I will get it from server, so browser goes to server, gets google.com, and gives it to you, you get google.com, now along with google.com, server sends all the images, videos, whatever things are there, like these icons, the url of these icons is also written in this code, and that is also browser's work, to show us properly, so server sends a bundle to the browser, and passing this bundle like this, is browser's work, now further, whatever interaction the user will do with this page, browser will send additional requests, if I right click and inspect, and then go to network, and here I write, let's say, harry bhai, I wrote harry bhai, so look, so many requests have been sent for images, and many more, so as you interact, you will have to send more requests additionally, so in total, you can think of it as a restaurant, you gave an order, you sent requests, you gave an order, a waiter took your order, and then he went to the kitchen, he sent your order to the kitchen, consider the kitchen as a server, and finally, when the kitchen gave the order back, so what did the waiter do, the browser is working, the waiter saw you and ordered back, it's possible that the order is not made in the kitchen, it's very rare that you order something and you didn't get it, but it happens, similarly, here also, you get to see errors, 404 error, or 500 error, the server is not working, so whenever you see such errors, you get to know, but ideally, 200 means ok response, and you get such a webpage, so you can think of it as a restaurant, so whenever you write google.com slash mail, so if google.com slash mail is available, it will show you, and if you write google.com slash contact, so if it's available, it will show you, if it's not available, it will show 404, or if it's 500 error, it will show you a page with 500, and whatever the server sends, it will show you, so this cycle keeps going, client sent requests, browser sent the server, server processed the request, and then the server sent the browser the data back, and whatever the data was sent, the browser showed it to the client, then the client did something, the browser sent the server the same request, then the server sent the same request, whatever the server sent, the browser showed it to the client, and so on, so now you'll think, this is ok, but what is back-end? what does back-end mean? Back-end is how the server is processing the request, now if you have a blog, there's a lot of data in the blog, so what will you do? Will you store every webpage of the blog separately, or will you dynamically generate that content? You will dynamically generate that content, I'll take google's example, if I search for harry by, you can see that google's header links, this format doesn't change at all, if I write here, say, Shubham, so as soon as I write Shubham, you can see that when I wrote harry by, google is showing me a similar content, so what does google do? the back-end of the google server, back-end processes the data in such a way that it can send this kind of HTML query, so when I write Shubham, it sends this, when I write harry by, it sends this, so the process of generating this is through the back-end, now this back-end can be Django, Flask, Node.js, this back-end can be PHP, Ruby on Rails, and the database used in the back-end is used, the back-end code is not visible to the client, this is the front-end code, which the server sends, and we don't know how the server made this code, because this code is running on the server, if you are confused, then don't be confused, you will understand all these things, we will see the back-end later, now we understand how the front-end works, the front-end is primarily made by three languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, these are three languages which are needed if you are making a website, every website needs HTML, CSS, JavaScript in most of the cases, if you use HTML only, then the basic skeleton of the website is made, after that, when you use CSS, you can style it, like this button looks like this, so it's only visible because of CSS, along with that, this button looks red, or this button looks like this, all this is done with the help of CSS, the edges you see here, all this is done with the help of CSS, so CSS is used to style a page, what color of a button, what will be done by hover, all these things are done with CSS, in a way, CSS is the beauty of HTML, HTML is the existence of any page, this is a standard which is agreed, if you make a website, then you will make it in HTML, so that the browser makers can understand how to parse it, the job of a browser is to parse HTML, and HTML is a skeleton, this is a standard, anyone who makes a website in this world, will make it in HTML, use it, this is a standard, this is a standard, this is a standard made so that everyone can make the same kind of pages, and if someone is making a browser, then they have to parse the same language, if as a beginner you have learned 80% HTML, then you are good to go for web development, now, some things are done directly with HTML, like if I write a quick HTML code, then I am writing HTML code like this, I have used the exclamation mark here, don't worry about how I have written this code, I will write, hey this is HTML, and I can open this HTML file directly like this, and as soon as I open this HTML file directly, you can see, it will open like this, I can open it directly by double clicking, and it opened, now see, hey this is HTML, but it is not styled, this HTML file is very basic, now you can run videos directly from HTML, I have an HTML file which I will show you, I will change this HTML file so that we can show videos, so HTML has a video tag, if we enter the video, then the video which we will put in src will play, like if I put video1.mp4 here, you can see, the VS code has automatically shown me video1.mp4, this is the benefit of using VS code, so you can see here, I will reload it, so the video is automatically shown, I can play it, to play it, I have to write controls, I will refresh it, so I will get the controls to play, I can play it, now if I put video2.mp4 here, I have put video1, I have two more videos, I have some more videos here, if I put it here, and after this, I will refer to them, if I put video2.mp4 here, then I will see video2, I will reload it, so this is Ben Stokes lookalike, if I put video3 here, then my third video will play, so I will reload it, and you can see, I can play it, so this is my third video, I have put video3.mp4 here, so I will close it, and in the same way, we can play video4, and I have a DJ video, in which DJ plays, so you can see, so you can make such things, by using only HTML, you don't have to do anything else, you can play videos and images with HTML, you can play videos and images, if you want to style it, if you want to have a border or background, then you have to use CSS, CSS adds beauty to a website, then JavaScript, which adds interaction to a website, for example, what will happen when I click on search, I have written hjar and autocomplete, why did it come here, because a request went to the server, and for this query, autocomplete results came here, so all these things are done with JavaScript, this is called client-side scripting, if we want to code on client side, then we can do it with JavaScript, this is also called brain, so our website is called beauty with brain, I'm talking about the website, beauty with brain, CSS adds beauty and brain comes from JavaScript, JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic, if you want to change the content, then all this is done with JavaScript, so many mosquitoes are coming here, so I'll kill them, they are not doing anything, my racket is working, like the video because I eat the electric shock for you, I want to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript one by one, first learn 100% HTML, then 100% CSS, but this is a wrong idea, why is it wrong, because you only have 80% of HTML, and only 40-60% of CSS, and JavaScript, you can learn 50-70% and start web development, and you can move forward, I'll tell you the impact of chat GPT on web development, so we'll talk about it, you guys stay tuned, so don't ever run after perfection, don't think that you'll do HTML for one year, then CSS for next year, then JavaScript for the third year, then you'll make projects in the fourth year, don't think like that, do HTML, 80%, CSS 40-60%, and JavaScript 50-70%, you can make a great website, you'll make a great website, your experience will teach you more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and you won't even know that you've perfected HTML, CSS, JavaScript, while you're making money and working as a professional web developer, so you'll be earning along with learning, and also you'll be moving forward with your skills, so don't think that you'll make a website only when you remember all the HTML tags, all the CSS properties, all the JavaScript, and I'll teach you only that much, that matters, we're going to learn what matters, and I don't want you to learn for years, so I've designed this course in this way, so that you'll be taught only what matters, and you'll learn the rest of the things in practice, and I'm going to teach you a lot of things in this course, here we have a couple of mosquitoes to learn the sigma web development course, which is good, our audience is increasing, in this course we'll learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'll teach you tricks that you've never heard before, I've learned different tricks in my career, I'll tell you all about them in this course, I've learned some amazing tricks in my career, and I want you to learn them while starting, now if you have any doubts in this course, you can use the hashtag doubt, and ask your doubts using this hashtag, I'm going to try to answer all the doubts, I'll try my best to solve your doubts, so if you want to ask any question, then use the hashtag doubt, and please don't use the hashtag doubt in your comments, and write it without using the hashtag doubt, so that I can prioritize the comments with the hashtag doubt, I'll try to answer all the doubts as much as I can, and you'll learn everything in this course, so please like this course, if you haven't done it yet, that'll bring a smile on my face, so please do it, now what is React, what is nextgs, what is angular, so all these front-end frameworks, help you to use JavaScript better, HTML CSS is a website, it helps you to make this process faster, how? we'll learn this in this course, yes, we'll learn it in this course, I told you that I'll make this course in a different way, I'll make you from zero to hero in web development, tie your chair, because you've got a ticket for Sigma Web Development Express, I want to give you a good analogy to teach HTML CSS and JavaScript, HTML is just like a car skeleton, if you paint it, it'll be CSS, and if you put it in an internal engine, it'll be JavaScript, as an example, the skeleton is HTML, if you put it in the skin, it'll be CSS, and if you put it in the brain, it'll be JavaScript, now I'll take you to Forbes.com, as soon as you go to Forbes, you'll see a website, and Forbes.com is a website that uses HTML CSS and JavaScript, just like any other website, now if I right click here, and click on inspect, then this inspect element is opened, now here you can see, they've used the script in the head, and to add CSS, they've used the link, so what I'll do here, I'll remove their CSS, so to remove CSS, I'll simply clear their style tags, and then I'll use delete key, so as soon as I remove all these style tags, and also remove all these link tags, so as soon as I delete all their styles, look at the condition of this page, this page looks like this, they've only got raw HTML, what should be the size of the images, what kind of images should be there, they've forgotten all this, and only raw HTML is written here, which hasn't been styled at all, so Forbes.com's condition is like this, without CSS, without CSS, they're showing only raw buttons, they're showing only raw text, raw links, and similarly, I can remove the script tags here, and see how this website will look without JavaScript, now if I delete the HTML tag of this page, like this, I've deleted the head, I've deleted all of this, so this is a blank page, so without HTML, it's not even there, so this is the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in making a web page, I want to tell you guys one thing, this course was initially made to be paid, but I changed my mood, I've converted it to D course, and I thought I'll put it on YouTube, so I want you guys to be serious, many people have reached out to me to launch this course, there are many big companies, but I was feeling that this course should be kept free, because when I was learning web development, I can understand that you don't have a course to learn well, and you don't have the affordability to buy a paid course, so I can understand, and I decided that this is a Sigma web development course, it should be absolutely free of cost, this course is free, but under this free scheme, you guys will earn crores of rupees, you guys will give me tea, coffee, parties, and all the gifts, this is our agreement in this video, so when you start earning crores, lakhs of rupees, then just send me a green leaf, or maybe a red leaf, but you have to do this only when you start earning well, only after you start earning good, so keeping this aside, in the next video, I'll tell you how you can earn money by completing this course, I'll put a light on this, because this is also important, come on, how will you get a job, how to earn money, that's also important, personally, how I do freelancing, how clients come, I'll tell you everything in this course, I want to tell you some action items, the first action item is to access this course playlist, which I'll give you in the description, everyone bookmark that playlist, press the star button here to open that playlist, and then press the star button to bookmark it, and save it in the playlist, some of you guys have said that the course is paid, that's why we'll buy it, thank you so much for all the support, and I hope that you guys show me love and trust, that encourages me, but this course is going to be free, now technical issues should not come, I'm putting all these videos in the resolution above 1080p, so you guys should see it very clearly, but many people say that the video is in Sd, 240p, 144p, you guys watch Bali's Wadhu, you finish the internet of Jio's mobile, watch Bali's Wadhu from morning to evening, and then you tell me that your videos are not in HD, call some Nagarpali, so I hope that you guys understood the request and response in this video, how all these websites work, we got a basic idea, how client-server interaction happens, in the upcoming videos, we'll see how the website is made, we'll make our first website in the next video, so you guys should be very excited, because in the next video, our first website is going to be made, and it may be that it's the first website, so access the playlist, thank you so much guys for watching this video, and I will see you next time."
