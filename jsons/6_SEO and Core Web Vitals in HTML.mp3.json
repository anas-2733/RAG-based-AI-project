    "text": " In this video, we will learn about Core Web Vitals and why Core Web Vitals are important Please like this video and keep the high energy on the line The thing is that your website should be available in all devices like iPad, iPhone, Android, Surface Pro 4 Because we have to give a good experience to all the users through our website In this video, we will also learn that Chrome has a hidden tool called Lighthouse and how you can use it to enhance your website So please write in the comment section Sigma Batch OP Let's go to the computer screen and let's roll the intro So guys, I have come to my computer screen and I will make a new folder called Video 6 and here I will open VS Code as always and today I will tell you about SEO First of all, I want to tell you about SEO SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization If you look at any website, it has SEO Let's take the example of Amazon.in I opened Amazon.in and Amazon.in wanted to load the website as soon as possible so that their products can be uploaded in the search engine Google is a search engine and Google's responsibility is to show the best pages to the users So Google wants to show the pages that are fast, present information well and along with that, there are some things that the user has the best experience For example, let us say there are two pages One page has told us about dog food The other page has also told us about dog food But page 2 loads very fast and Google will give it more preference Along with that, there are core web vitals which Google considers to rank two pages First of all, content is important If your content is good, then your website can rank without the core web vitals But if you are competing with a page that has presented similar quality content then your core web vitals will be seen and if your core web vitals are good, then you will be given preference So the first thing that comes to the core web vitals is your CLS You see this video here which I have run from web.dev website You see that someone comes to your website and he is trying to cancel the order and by mistake he cancelled the order and this thing on top of it became visible and he shifted the layout and the order was completed but the user wanted to click on no when the order was not completed In this case, the user experience is very bad and as you have seen in this video, this should not happen so our CLS should be less Now what is the definition of CLS? Cumulative Layout Shift means how much the page is shifting while loading Suppose you have loaded the page and you get to see this This was first on top and then when this part was loaded, then it shifted The layout should not shift if you put width and height in the images The next metric that we are going to talk about is LCP and LCP stands for Largest Contextual Paint This means that if the user is viewing a page, then the biggest element is loaded For example, the biggest part in this is this image How long is it loading? The whole page will be loaded but the biggest element which is the most important How long is it loading? Web.dev and Google should have a good LCP score of 2.5 seconds which means that the biggest element should be loaded in 2.5 seconds After this comes the third metric which is FID which stands for First Input Delay First Input Delay means that if a user has clicked on any input element like a button or any input on a page then how long does the input process take place For example, if you have clicked on a button, then how long does the button click browser process Google and Web.dev should have a 100 ms less input process So these were the 3 core web vitals which are very important For your information, I will tell you that these core web vitals are updated but these 3 are very important and you should know about them Now I will show you what is Lighthouse report and why it is generated and how these 3 core web vitals are going to be evaluated So I will tell you here If you will inspect it by right-clicking and it may be your input, it is coming in the right side You can bring it down by right-clicking or you can bring it down by right-clicking I prefer to bring it down because I am used to see it from the beginning Now you can see the Lighthouse option Lighthouse generates a report and tells you what can be improved in your HTML page For example, if I want to see how my website looks on mobile then I will click on mobile or desktop and close this tab I will click on mobile and then on analyze page load then it will generate a report for me You can see here that a report has been generated It shows performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO and PWA Now you can see here that some things are shown in red which means the scope of improvement is in the page Now you can see that it tells you to size your images properly Your website can load 2.7 seconds faster So all these suggestions are given to you by Lighthouse If you incorporate these suggestions, your website will load well and give you a good experience Now you can see that it says here that image elements do not have explicit width and height So you should give width and height You should use the width and height attribute that we had studied in the previous video so that your browser can reserve space When we set width and height in HTML, space gets reserved in the browser Otherwise, if we don't set the height and width, then the browser won't know how much space to reserve and the longer the CSS load, the page will shift down So we don't want our page to shift during loading time If our page starts shifting, then we can click here and when it shifts, we can click here Suppose I'm going to click here and this image loads during the time I clicked and all the content shifts down and instead of clicking here, I click on the image This is called cumulative layout shift So Google doesn't prefer this kind of shift and it should be reduced As you can see, this page has very less cumulative layout shift So we have to keep the cumulative layout shift at minimum so that our users can get a very good experience So here we get many more suggestions and this is for our mobile Now we can generate desktop report and it will be generated So as you can see, it has generated a report It has 92 marks in performance It has been given 100 out of 82 in accessibility 75 in best practices and 75 in SEO Now you can see that all the good things have been told and all the scope of improvement that Lighthouse tells you So this is a hidden tool that you should use Now I want to tell you about Meta text and Meta description So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to name it index.html and after creating an HTML file the first SEO element that I want to tell you is the title If your title is reflecting the content of your page then this is a very good SEO practice Whenever your page is changing, you should make the title so that it reflects the content of your page because if you want your website on Google then it will come according to the title So let's say you write here Google index is code with harry and you write like this So this is the title of the page and this is the title of the page which is put by YouTube this is the title of the page which is put by Instagram this is the title of the page which is put by Github So if the title is put on the page and the title reflects the content of the page then your website will rank very well Now let's say I put the content and I put an h1 and I write harry and after that I write a paragraph and I write lorem45 Now why did I write lorem45 I'll do a view word wrap Why did I write 45 I wrote 45 because I'm lazy and 4 and 5 are around so I wrote 4 and 5 I also write 23 because they are around Now I'll preview it I'll open in browser Now this document is written If I leave it like this, it won't be a good SEO practice I'll write about harry and I'll write code with harry which is my website and by doing this, my title will reflect here as you can see So by doing this my website will be more visible in Google I'll inspect it and I'll also take out its light house report and I'll see what are the scope of improvements Now its light house report will be very good because there is nothing that I should improve but when I'll put images, I'll get suggestions like put width put height along with that, I'll tell you another trick by which you can see your website in any mobile you'll get to know so you can click here you can see the computer here and if you choose responsive then you can see how your website will look in any kind of device so you can see whether your website is responsive by doing this if you go to a specific device in 12 Pro, your website will look like this in the resolution of iPhone 12 Pro now don't ask why it's not 15 or 16 12 Pro means a big iPhone device in such a big device how your website will look you can see it simply so now you can see how it will look in surface pro 7 by clicking here how it will look in Google phones you can also see this and if you want to take a general view of your website in responsive device in any kind of device like in iPad if you don't have a device then you can choose responsive and take approximate width of your device so your website should look good in all widths I'll tell you how it looks in this course now if you click here again then it will stop and as soon as it stops, your website will look like this I'll close it I'll come back here and tell you about Meta tax here I'll write if I write here, then Meta DESC is coming I'll click on Meta DESC and I can give my page description let's say I give this is the page this is a page about this is a page which contains description about Harry and here you can write whatever page content you want like I'll show you suppose you write what is SEO what is SEO you have written this page has put this Meta description SEO stands for this it's not necessary that a search engine will pass your Meta DESC if it likes it, then it will pass and keep your Meta DESC here if you haven't put Meta DESC, then your content can be generated from Meta DESC so this is the responsibility of the search engine we don't know what Bing or Google will do but from our side, our page should be to the point especially if we are writing a blog and we want our page to rank organically so here you can see that I have put Meta DESC the keyword used to be very good but now the Meta keyword has been deprecated Meta keyword is not used at all Meta keyword's code looks like this but it is assumed that Meta keywords don't rank in SEO because people abuse it suppose you have written a page about pets and you have written what is SEO in Meta keyword so it's not like your page will rank I'll fix these double quotes so if I put Meta keyword here, then it's not necessary that a search engine will constrict it search engines don't believe in Meta keywords they say that they don't want to see your Meta keywords so don't put them Meta keywords used to be very good but now it's not, your content is parsed and now AI is coming so your content will be understood and your content will be ranked now if you want to know about exactly these core web vitals for example, if I inspect it right click and go to Lighthouse and get a Lighthouse report for desktop then some core web vitals come and then FCP comes First Contextual Paint now you can see everything is 100% there was nothing much in this content but you can see here that pages with websocket cannot enter back, forward, cache this has websocket because we are using this extension live preview otherwise it's good, accessibility is also good everything is good, it's a very good page PWA is Progressive Web Apps which we won't make now but you can see here total blocking time, cumulative layout shift speed index if you want to know about all these like what is first contextual paint which is going to be seen by the user how long it has been painted on the browser so if you want to see this then you have to go to web.dev web.dev is a very good website and you can see here that they talk about this you can learn about all these things if you want to learn PWA you can learn PWA there is a lot of good content but in this course we will focus on creating HTML, CSS, JavaScript and websites this thing should have come to you because of which I told you about this if you haven't accessed sigma web development then do do it access the playlist bookmark it by clicking here and save it by clicking here that's it for this video thank you so much for watching this video and I will see you next time Thank you"
