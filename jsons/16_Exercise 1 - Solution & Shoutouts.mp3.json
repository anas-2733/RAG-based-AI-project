    "text": " Guys, in video number 12, I gave you an exercise and I told you all to post your solution In today's video, I'll solve that exercise and I'll give a shout out to all the people who solved that exercise Let's go to the computer screen I'm really very excited to see your solutions Let's roll the intro Intro So guys, I'm inside my computer screen and the first thing I'll do is I'll make a folder named video 16 so I'll type video 16 and then I'll open it and click on shift right click, open with code and after that, I'll make a boilerplate template Today, we're going to do something special because today, we'll get a shout out So, first of all, if you haven't accessed the playlist then do it Now, I'm going to open this video So, I opened this video in which I gave you an exercise and this exercise was about a pure HTML media player So, I told you all to make a media player and here I'll sort by new as first and I'll come down and after coming down, I'll give a shout out to all the people who solved this So guys, I've scrolled down I took a lot of time to scroll to be honest, I'll give a shout out to all but before that, I want to solve this question So, here you can see 1.mp3, 1.mp4, 2.mp3, all the way till 5.mp3 So, what I'll do first is I'll put an H1 My videos for the day I'll write H1 here and I'll write some audios for the day Okay, my videos and audios for the day What I'll do here is I'll toggle screencast mode because it looks a little easy and here I'll put some videos So, I wrote H1 here and I'll put an H2 here and here I'll simply put videos in a dev So, as soon as I write video tag here and after that I'll write controls here So, I'll be able to watch this 1.mp4 So, what I'll do is I'll press shift, alt and down arrow and I'll write 2, 3, 4, 5 and I'll do the same thing for audio as well and here I'll write audio and here I'll write 1.mp3 and after that I'll write controls and after that I'll do the same thing and I'll replicate it 5 times I did 2, 3, 4 and here I'll write 5 and obviously I'll preview it and try to show it to you Now, there's a problem here and the problem is it's taking a lot of width and it's becoming problematic for me maybe because I'm zoomed in so, it's not problematic actually otherwise we could have reset it from CSS but for now, I think we're good We'll see how to resize it in CSS and how to improve it but I think our videos are here and some audios for the day are here as well so, you can see the audios and if you play songs then songs will come I haven't played songs yet so, you can see my videos play Hey sir, give me something to eat and these are the same videos This is a jackpot for selling and this is my personal favourite You must have uploaded your favorite videos but that was pretty much about it Many people are saying that this is very easy this exercise was so simple I'll raise the bar like anything Remember my words Now, let's give shoutouts Shoutout to Saumya172 Shoutout to Codewithrohit who accepted the challenge Here, multiatmos DesiReady Shantop, Harsh Guleria Hellstar Kun Team Reva, Kulsum Saqibward Bobby01th Shoutout to Mohan 2492 Prakash, Arnav Jilan HR, Nikhil L Ashutosh Now, I'll give shoutouts to those who actually solved the problem I'll give shoutouts to those who actually solved the problem Did anyone actually solve the problem?

No one actually solved the problem No one actually solved the problem Not even now Okay, so Coder Anderson Congratulations to you all You won 7 crore rupees for the first time You used the tables, which was fine I think that I don't use tables ideally especially for such tasks But I think we are good From 1 to 6, they have shown the videos They have also given width and height Which is a great thing I'll also do it in my video In fact, I'll write Width is equal to 239 Let's see how it changes It is looking actually better Why didn't I think of this? Cody Anderson I'll give shoutouts to you all Sorry, Cody Anderson Now, who has solved the next problem? SAF0981 You have also solved this problem with a beautiful way Very good Amazing Then I'll give shoutouts to Cesar Murti I've given a very big shoutout And also to Jeel Maheshwari I want to say something here I have done a lot of work This was not the participation I wanted more participation I wanted everyone to solve it Very few people have solved it Here I want that more people solve it Saqshim Jain has solved it I saw that very few people have solved this And here I can't see any other code In the upcoming videos I want everyone to solve the challenges I'll give shoutouts in the comments So you all have to respond a little faster And everyone who has accepted the challenge I hope you all are enjoying this course All the source code and the playlist You all should definitely access it The playlist looks very populated It was a few days ago I had written one video But now I have failed And your enthusiasm should also be If you haven't accessed the source code Then you have to do it That's it for this video Thank you"
